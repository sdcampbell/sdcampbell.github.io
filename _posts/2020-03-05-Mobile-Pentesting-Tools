## Mobile Pentesting Tools

### Apktool

A tool for reverse engineering 3rd party, closed, binary Android apps. It can decode resources to nearly original form and rebuild them after making some modifications. It also makes working with an app easier because of the project like file structure and automation of some repetitive tasks like building apk, etc.

Install on Kali: sudo apt install -y apktool

Decompile an app: apktool d test.apk

### Jadx

Command line and GUI tools for produce Java source code from Android Dex and Apk files.

Installation on Kali: sudo apt install -y jadx

### Drozer

Drozer (formerly Mercury) is the leading security testing framework for Android.

drozer allows you to search for security vulnerabilities in apps and devices by assuming the role of an app and interacting with the Dalvik VM, other apps' IPC endpoints and the underlying OS.

drozer provides tools to help you use, share and understand public Android exploits. It helps you to deploy a drozer Agent to a device through exploitation or social engineering. Using weasel (MWR's advanced exploitation payload) drozer is able to maximise the permissions available to it by installing a full agent, injecting a limited agent into a running process, or connecting a reverse shell to act as a Remote Access Tool (RAT).

drozer is open source software, maintained by MWR InfoSecurity, and can be downloaded from: mwr.to/drozer

### MobSF

Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is an automated, all-in-one mobile application (Android/iOS/Windows) pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis. https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF

### Fridump

Fridump (v0.1) is an open source memory dumping tool, primarily aimed to penetration testers and developers. Fridump is using the Frida framework to dump accessible memory addresses from any platform supported. It can be used from a Windows, Linux or Mac OS X system to dump the memory of an iOS, Android or Windows application. https://github.com/Nightbringer21/fridump
