I tired of maintaining my own Wordpress blog, and issues with Wordpress on Digital Ocean resulted in my database going down repeatedly. Now I'm hosting on github.io and don't have to worry about site security, databases, etc., just write and publish!

I don't plan to move over any of my old blog except for the latest post: "Interested vs. Commtted".
