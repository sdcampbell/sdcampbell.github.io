Docker has some very good use cases for pentesters. I cover what is Docker, how to install it, basic usage, and some interesting use cases for penetration testers. This video covers using Docker to run pentesting tools, not how to exploit docker containers.

Something not mentioned in the video that I learned recently... you can run applications in Docker that have a GUI using the following example:

```
xhost +local:docker
docker run --rm -e DISPLAY=${DISPLAY} -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v $HOME:/root --privileged <container name>
```
