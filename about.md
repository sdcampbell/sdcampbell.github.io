I have over thirteen years experience in information security. Experienced in network, wireless, and web application penetration testing, vulnerability management, networking, firewalls, AAA, Active Directory, application and server virtualization… I’ve worked with most of the enterprise IT stack over my career. My certifications: GXPN, OSCP, OSWP, Security+, CCNA (Expired), CCA

I’m a retired Navy Aviation Electrician, and have worked on P-3 Orion aircraft as well as various models of H-60 helo’s. I started out as an Undesignated Airman, and once I decided on becoming an Aviation Electrician, I worked in the AE shop during my spare time and learned electronics by reading the Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) guides. One of my best attributes is the ability to pick up a book, (or these days use my google-fu) and figure out how to get things done.

In my spare time I enjoy learning and doing infosec labs, riding my Harley and being outdoors with my beautiful wife.

My favorite quote is from H.D. Moore: “If you don’t think you’re a n00b, you’re not trying hard enough.”
