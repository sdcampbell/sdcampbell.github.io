I have over thirteen years experience in information security. Experienced in network, wireless, and web application penetration testing, vulnerability management, networking, firewalls, AAA, Active Directory, application and server virtualization… I’ve worked with most of the enterprise IT stack over my career. My certifications: GXPN, OSCP, OSWP, Security+, CCNA (Expired), CCA

I’m a retired Navy Aviation Electrician, and have worked on P-3 Orion aircraft as well as various models of H-60 helo’s. I started out as an Undesignated Airman, and once I decided on becoming an Aviation Electrician, I worked in the AE shop during my spare time and learned electronics by reading the Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) guides. One of my best attributes is the ability to pick up a book, (or these days use my google-fu) and figure out how to get things done.

In my spare time I enjoy learning and doing infosec labs, riding my Harley and being outdoors with my beautiful wife.

My favorite quote is from H.D. Moore: “If you don’t think you’re a n00b, you’re not trying hard enough.”

The idea that has had the greatest affect on my success is "interest vs. committment". If you're interested in doing something, you'll most likely fail unless your goals are really easy and insignificant. To acheive your goals and change your life you must be committed. When you're committed, you don't make nor accept excuses. If you goal is to lose 20 pounds and you say that you're going to wake up early and exercise, you don't hit the snooze button when your alarm goes off, or try to justify to yourself why it's ok to eat just this one junkfood snack. If your goal is to earn an infsec certification or learn a skill but you're too tired to study or lab at night because of long working hours or family committments, set your alarm to wake up early. Some goals that I acheived which had the greatest affect on my infosec career only happened because I committed myself to waking up at 4:30 each weekday morning to work on my OSCP cert, and then I kept going after getting the cert in order to have more time to learn and lab. TBH I have allowed myself an extra half hour of sleep and now wake up at 5 even though I don't have to be at work until 8 to 9 and my office is in my home.

I struggle daily with committment, because we're human and it's easy to make excuses why this one time its okay to skip a workout or eat an unhealthy snack. The main reason why I struggle with committment relates to achieving my career goals and learning path. I work from home. I really love my work... so much that if I hit the lottery I'd still do this for fun. When I'm on a client engagement and wake up early at 5 for study time, I find myself thinking about testing I did the day before and what I plan to do for the day and even start reviewing data from the previous day's tests. I have to repeatedly remind myself that until start of working hours I'm on my time, not my client's, and when I do this I'm giving free work to the client and robbing myself of career and personal development time. In my opinion, this struggle to keep work and personal life separate is the only drawback that I've found to working from home.
